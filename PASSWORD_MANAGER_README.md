- Never stored in plain text
- Cannot be recovered if forgotten
- Must meet strength requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character

### Data Structure

interface PasswordEntry {
id: string;
title: string;

password: string;
website?: string;
notes?: string;
category?: string;
createdAt: number;
updatedAt: number;
}
